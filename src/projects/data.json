            "desc": "A Gesture Controlled robot is a one which can be controlled by your hand gestures. A hand detection program which uses PYTHON and OpenCV detects the gesture and transmits  an appropriate command to the bot via bluetooth connection. This data is then processed by a microcontroller which relays it to a motor driver which controls the motors and their speed. This way we can incorporate various types of movements as per our requirement and get the bot to execute it.",

LiDAR is an acronym of Light detection and ranging or Laser imaging, detection, and ranging. Typically, light is reflected via backscattering, as opposed to pure reflection one might find with a mirror.",
